Taken from https://github.com/renemarc/dotfiles/blob/master/dot_config/iterm/symlink_com.googlecode.iterm2.plist.tmpl

To keep any modifications done inside iTerm2 in sync with this repo, this file
is parsed and turned into a symbolic link pointing to
`com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` when running `chezmoi apply`. The actual plist
file is not copied over to the user home directory.

The linked file com.googlecode.iterm2.plist is loaded by iTerm2 when the `Load
preferences from a custom folder or URL` setting is enabled in
`iTerm2 → General → Preferences`.
