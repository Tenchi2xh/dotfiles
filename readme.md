## Install

On a new computer:

- First, install Brew and the two top-level dependencies:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    brew install chezmoi bitwarden-cli
    ```

- Then, log in and unlock the Bitwarden vault, then copy paste the `export` command:

    ```bash
    bw login
    bw unlock
    ```

- Finally, run `chezmoi`:

    ```bash
    chezmoi init --apply Tenchi2xh
    ```

## TODO

- Visual Studio Code pre-configuration for theme, settings, extensions
